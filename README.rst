This is the new collection of files for the physical side of MoaT:
Schematics and layouts (kicad), Enclosures (Blender).

Parts
=====

Servo
+++++

A small interface to control two servos and/or up to three other signals.

The board has two standard servo plugs (GND/+5V/PWM) and three wired I/O
ports. All five I/Os can also be used as digital output or as analog or
digital input.

Since timing is not critical, the system will use the controller's built-in
8 MHz clock.
