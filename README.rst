This is the collection of files for the physical side of MoaT:
Schematics and layouts (kicad), Enclosures (OpenSCAD).

---
BMS
---

Controller and module for battery management.

The hardware design supports both active-high (diyBMS) and active-low
(MoaT) serial connections.


----
Wire
----

Connect some wires to the MoaT board.

misc
----

Random stuff (Enocean adapter, USB intercept, â€¦).

CPUs
====

The ``proc/`` directory contains CPU boards, i.e. things that have a bus plug.

CPUs are responsible for adapting 1wire (5V) and MoaTbus (12V) to their
internal voltage.


Boards
======

The ``board/`` directory contains everything that has a bus socket, i.e.
interfaces to the Real World.

Many of these boards have 12V-MoaTbus, 5V-1wire, and/or 3.3V-I2C connectors.

The boards are not responsible for translating voltages to the (commonly)
3.3V which CPUs expect.

Breadboard
++++++++++

The most important part. Use this to test CPUs.

Heating
+++++++

This board has two transistors to switch one or two 24V radiator
valves (PPM).

Smoke detector
++++++++++++++

This board fits into a Gira Dual or Q smoke detector.


Old stuff
=========

The ``old/`` directory contains things I need to clean up.
